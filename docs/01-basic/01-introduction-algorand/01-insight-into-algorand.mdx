## Our Founder
-   [Silvio Micali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Micali)
    -   **Silvio Micali** Born October 13, 1954 - is an Italian computer
        scientist, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology and the founder of Algorand, a proof-of-stake
        blockchain cryptocurrency protocol. Micali's research at the MIT
        Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory centers
        on cryptography and information security.
    -   In 2012, he received the **Turing Award** for his work in
        cryptography
    -   Co-inventor of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, **VRF ( Verifiable Random
        Functions )**, and a world-renowned leader in the field of
        cryptography and information security
